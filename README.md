# onenote_list_progress
##Target Feature
<ul>
    <li>Daily todo list</li>
    <li>Project based todo list</li>
</ul>
## Motive
I've always been using onenote as todo list, but it sometimes hard to to tell keep track of the progress of mutiple todo lists in a glence. I'm thinking of add a specific tag to the target todo list in onenote to visualize the workflow.
